# Common Clutter

1. Dead weight words and phrases
2. Empty words and phrases
3. Long words or phrases that could be short
4. Unnecessary jargon and acronyms
5. Repetitive words or phrases
6. Adverbs

# Dead weight words and phrases

These can be removed directly. Instead, give references.

- As it is well known
- As it has been shown
- It can be regarded that
- It should be emphasized that

# Empty words and phrases

These can be removed directly, as it conveys no information.

- basic tenets of
- methodologic
- important

# Long words or phrases that could be short

e.g.

The expected prevalence of mental retardation, **based on the assumption that** intelligence is normally distributed, is about 2.5%.

$$\downarrow$$

The expected prevalence of mental retardation, **if** intelligence is normally distributed, is about 2.5%.

# Unnecessary jargon and acronyms

A jargon/acronym should not contain another jargon/acronym.
Too many jargons/acronyms slow down the readers.

- muscular and cardiorespiratory performance
- Gliomagenesis
- miR

# Repetitive words or phrases

Only one word should be left in the following cases:

- studies/examples
- illustrate/demonstrate
- challenges/difficulties
- successful solutions

e.g.

A robust cell-mediated immune response is necessary, and deficiency in this response predisposes an individual towards active TB.

$$\downarrow$$

Deficiency in T-cell-mediated immune response predisposes an individual to active TB.

# Adverbs

Just remove them. These should never exist in the scientific paper.

- very
- really
- quite
- basically
- generally
