# It's OK to use "We" and "I"

- The active voice is livelier and easier to read.
- Avoiding personal pronouns **does not** make your science more objective.
  - You/your team designed, conducted, and interpreted the experiments. To imply otherwise is misleading.
  - The experiments and analysis did not materialize out of thin air!
  - The goal is to **be** more objective, not to **appear** more objective.
- By agreeing to be an author on the paper, you are taking responsibility for its content. Thus, you should also claim responsibility for the assertions in the text by using "We" or "I".
