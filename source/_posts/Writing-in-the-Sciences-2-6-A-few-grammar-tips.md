# Affect vs. Effect

Affect is the verb "to influence"

Effect is the noun form of "this influence"

- The class had an effect on her.

# Compared to vs. Compared with

Compared to: to point out **similarities** between **different** things

Compared with ** (used more often in science): point out **differences** between **similar** things

- Brain tumors are relatively rare compared with more common cancers, such as those of the lung, breast, and prostate.

# That vs. Which

Which: is the **nonrestrictive** (non-defining) pronoun

- The **non-essential** clause **can** be eliminated without altering the basic meaning of the sentence (and must be set off by commas)

# Singular Antecedents

Do not use "they" or "their" when the subject is singular.
To avoid gender choice, turn to a plural!

- Each student worries about ~~her~~ grade.
- Better: All students worry about their grades.
